# Blog-example-with-Tinymce
This is blog example for your own use.
For design was used Bulma(navbar, blocks, comment style). For logo text- was used google fonts(Red Hat Mono SemiBold 600)
Bulma link- https://bulma.io/
Google Fonts Red Hat Mono link- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Mono
Logic was made by Django. JS almost wasn't used(only tinymce ready JavaScript).
U can change images in django admin panel in ur browser.
